# Enhanced Terminal User Experience

## Warp-Style Terminal Features

### 1. Inline Suggestions
```python
class InlineSuggestionEngine:
    """Real-time inline suggestions like Warp"""
    
    def get_inline_suggestion(self, current_input: str, cursor_pos: int) -> Suggestion:
        """Get suggestion to display inline as user types"""
        pass
    
    def show_command_preview(self, command: str) -> CommandPreview:
        """Show preview of what command will do"""
        pass
    
    def display_autocomplete_popup(self, matches: List[str]) -> None:
        """Show popup with autocomplete options"""
        pass
```

### 2. Enhanced Shell Integration
```bash
# Enhanced zsh integration with real-time features
function _openagent_live_suggest() {
    local buffer="$BUFFER"
    local suggestion
    
    # Get real-time suggestion from OpenAgent
    suggestion=$(openagent suggest "$buffer" --inline 2>/dev/null)
    
    if [[ -n "$suggestion" ]]; then
        # Display suggestion in gray text
        echo -e "\033[90m$suggestion\033[0m"
    fi
}

# Bind to key events for real-time suggestions
autoload -U add-zsh-hook
add-zsh-hook preexec _openagent_live_suggest
```

### 3. Rich Output Formatting
```python
class TerminalRenderer:
    """Enhanced terminal output rendering"""
    
    def render_command_result(self, result: ToolResult) -> str:
        """Render command results with syntax highlighting"""
        pass
    
    def render_error_with_suggestions(self, error: str, suggestions: List[str]) -> str:
        """Render errors with fix suggestions"""
        pass
    
    def render_diff_preview(self, changes: List[Change]) -> str:
        """Render file changes preview"""
        pass
    
    def render_progress_indicator(self, task: str, progress: float) -> None:
        """Show progress for long-running tasks"""
        pass
```
