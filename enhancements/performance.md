# Performance Optimization Strategy

## Speed Enhancements for Warp-Level Performance

### 1. Model Optimization
```python
class ModelOptimizer:
    """Advanced model optimization for faster inference"""
    
    def implement_model_caching(self):
        """Keep frequently used models in memory"""
        pass
    
    def setup_quantization(self):
        """4-bit/8-bit quantization for faster inference"""
        pass
    
    def enable_compilation(self):
        """Use torch.compile for 2x speed improvements"""
        pass
    
    def batch_processing(self):
        """Batch multiple requests for efficiency"""
        pass
```

### 2. Response Streaming
```python
class StreamingEngine:
    """Real-time response streaming"""
    
    async def stream_response(self, query: str) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
        """Stream response tokens as they're generated"""
        pass
    
    def implement_speculative_execution(self):
        """Start generating response before user finishes typing"""
        pass
    
    def cache_common_responses(self):
        """Cache responses for frequent queries"""
        pass
```

### 3. Intelligent Caching
```python
class CacheManager:
    """Multi-level caching for performance"""
    
    def setup_response_cache(self):
        """Cache responses for repeated queries"""
        pass
    
    def setup_context_cache(self):
        """Cache project context analysis"""
        pass
    
    def setup_model_cache(self):
        """Cache model outputs and embeddings"""
        pass
```

### 4. Background Processing
```python
class BackgroundProcessor:
    """Background processing for proactive assistance"""
    
    def preprocess_workspace(self):
        """Analyze workspace in background"""
        pass
    
    def preload_suggestions(self):
        """Preload likely next commands"""
        pass
    
    def update_context_continuously(self):
        """Keep context updated in background"""
        pass
```
