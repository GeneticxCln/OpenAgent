# Enhanced Context Understanding Implementation

## Context Engine Enhancements

### 1. Project Context Awareness
```python
class ProjectContextEngine:
    """Enhanced project understanding similar to Warp"""
    
    def analyze_workspace(self, path: Path) -> WorkspaceContext:
        """Analyze current workspace for project type, structure, dependencies"""
        pass
    
    def detect_project_type(self) -> ProjectType:
        """Detect if it's a Python, Node.js, Rust, Go, etc. project"""
        pass
    
    def get_relevant_files(self, command: str) -> List[Path]:
        """Get files relevant to the current command context"""
        pass
    
    def understand_git_state(self) -> GitContext:
        """Deep git context: current branch, changes, merge conflicts, etc."""
        pass
```

### 2. Command History Intelligence
```python
class HistoryIntelligence:
    """Learn from user command patterns like Warp"""
    
    def analyze_command_patterns(self) -> CommandPatterns:
        """Identify frequently used command sequences"""
        pass
    
    def predict_next_command(self, context: Context) -> List[str]:
        """Predict what user might want to do next"""
        pass
    
    def learn_from_corrections(self, original: str, corrected: str):
        """Learn when user corrects/modifies suggestions"""
        pass
```

### 3. Environment Awareness
```python
class EnvironmentContext:
    """Understanding of current environment state"""
    
    def get_active_processes(self) -> ProcessContext:
        """Understand what's currently running"""
        pass
    
    def analyze_system_state(self) -> SystemContext:
        """CPU, memory, disk usage impact on suggestions"""
        pass
    
    def detect_development_environment(self) -> DevEnvironment:
        """Docker, K8s, virtual environments, etc."""
        pass
```
